    "\"DP\":\"DP, or dynamic programming, is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler sub-problems. It involves solving each sub-problem only once and storing the solutions in a table for future use. DP is used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the optimal solution among many possible solutions. It is often more efficient than brute force or other methods, but requires careful analysis and design of the sub-problems. DP is commonly used in fields such as computer science, engineering, and finance.\"\n",

They provide a means for organizing and managing data, and are essential for efficient algorithm design. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, and selecting the appropriate structure depends on the nature of the data and the operations to be performed on it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Brute Force\":\"Brute force is a straightforward approach to problem-solving that exhaustively searches all possible solutions. It involves systematically testing each possible solution until the correct one is found. This approach is often used when the problem size is small, or when other methods are not feasible. Brute force can be computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems, but it is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, if one exists. It is commonly used in algorithm design for testing and benchmarking.\"\n",
