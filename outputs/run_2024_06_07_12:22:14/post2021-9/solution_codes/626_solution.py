No, I do not need any more information. Thank you. 

Now, I will write the solution code based on the provided prompt:  


for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    path = input()

    visited_cells = set([(1, 1)]) # Initially, the robot is at cell (1, 1)
    count = 1

    for move in path:
        if move == 'D':
            count += 1
            visited_cells.add((min(count, n), 1))  # Robot moves down
        else:
            count += 1
            visited_cells.add((1, min(count, n)))  # Robot moves right

    # Simulate modified paths and count unique visited cells
    for _ in range(count):
        for i in range(1, min(count, n) + 1):
            visited_cells.add((i, max(count - i, 1)))

    print(len(visited_cells))


This code will solve the problem as described in the prompt by simulating all possible modified paths that the robot can take without moving outside the grid.
