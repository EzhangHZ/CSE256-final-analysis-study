# Test Function Call
min_games_to_reach_rating(t, test_cases)


The above code defines a function `min_games_to_reach_rating` that takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test case tuples as input. It then iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum number of games Monocarp needs to play to reach the desired rating `y`. Finally, it prints the minimum number of games for each test case.

You can run this code with the provided example test cases to verify the output.
