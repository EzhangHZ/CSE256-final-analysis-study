# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of arrays a and b.

4. Read array a containing n odd, distinct integers and array b containing n even, distinct integers.

5. Initialize a variable operations_needed to 0.

6. Loop through each index i from 1 to n-1.

    a. Check if the element at index i of array a is greater than the element at index i of array b.
    
    b. If true, swap the elements at index i and index i+1 in array a and increment operations_needed by 1.
    
7. Print the final value of operations_needed for each test case.

8. End all loops.
