# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the binary string s.

4. Read the binary string s of length n.

5. Define a function f(x) that calculates the number of good extensions of a given string x.

6. Initialize a variable answer to store the final answer.

7. Initialize a variable mod as 998244353 for modulo operation.

8. Loop from 1 to n:
    - Calculate f(s[1, i]) for each prefix of s.
    - Add f(s[1, i]) to the answer.
    - Update the answer modulo mod after each addition.

9. Output the answer modulo mod for each test case.

10. End all loops.
