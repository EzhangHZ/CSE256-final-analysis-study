# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read l and r, the range of integers for the initial array.

4. Read the final array a of length (r - l + 1).

5. Iterate through all possible integers x from 0 to $2^{17}$.

6. For each x, calculate the original array using the given range (l to r) and final array elements.

7. Check if the calculated original array matches the final array. If it does, output x and break the loop.

8. End loop and move to next test case.

You may use the given algorithms and knowledge about bitmasks, brute force, data structures, and math to design an efficient solution to help Marin find the secret integer x in Gojou's game of hide-and-seek with the array.
