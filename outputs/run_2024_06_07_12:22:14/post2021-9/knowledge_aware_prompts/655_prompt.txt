# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read $n, m,$ and $k$, the number of rows and columns of the pictures and the number of copies made.

2. Loop to read $k+1$ pictures, each consisting of $n$ lines with $m$ characters, $0$ or $1$, and an empty line.

3. Implement an approach to restore the sequence of operations applied to the pictures. You may consider using constructive algorithms to build the solution step-by-step.

4. Output the index of the initial picture, the number of operations, and list the operations in the order they were applied. Include recoloring a cell and making a copy of the current picture.

5. Ensure that each index from $1$ to $k+1$ appears in the output exactly once, with one being the index of the initial picture and the remaining $k$ being arguments of the operations of the second kind.

6. If multiple answers exist, you can print any valid sequence of operations.

7. End the implementation with the correct formatting of the output.

Feel free to use graph traversals (dfs and similar algorithms) if needed to restore the sequence of operations on the pictures.
