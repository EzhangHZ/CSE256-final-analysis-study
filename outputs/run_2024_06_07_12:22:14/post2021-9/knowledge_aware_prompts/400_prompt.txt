# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the permutation.

4. Read the elements of the permutation p.

5. Create a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components.

6. Initialize the DSU with n elements.

7. For each pair of elements (i, j) where i < j and p[i] > p[j], merge the sets containing i and j in the DSU.

8. Count the number of distinct components in the DSU after processing all pairs.

9. Print the number of connected components for each test case.

10. End all loops.
