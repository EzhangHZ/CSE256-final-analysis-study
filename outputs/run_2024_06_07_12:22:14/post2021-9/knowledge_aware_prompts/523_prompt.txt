# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n and d, the number of people and number of conditions.
  
2. Loop d times to read each condition.

3. Create a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connections between people.

4. Loop d times to merge the subsets based on the given conditions.

5. Initialize a list max_acquaintances with n zeros to keep track of the maximal number of acquaintances one person can have.

6. Loop from 1 to d inclusive:

   7. Perform one introduction between two people who were not familiar before.
   
   8. Update the maximal number of acquaintances the person with the maximal possible acquaintances will have based on the updated connections by DSU. Store the maximum number of acquaintances in max_acquaintances[i-1].
  
9. Output d integers, each representing the maximum number of acquaintances for the person after performing i introductions and satisfying the first i conditions.

10. End of the loop.

By following these steps, you can efficiently calculate the maximal number of acquaintances one person can have based on the introduced conditions and performed introductions at the cryptocurrency conference.
