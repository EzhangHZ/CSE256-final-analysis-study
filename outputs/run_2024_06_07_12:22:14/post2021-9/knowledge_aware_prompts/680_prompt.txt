# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate over each test case:

    2.1 Read the number of dishes, $n$, and the amount of food to eat from each dish, $m$.
    
    2.2 Read the masses of fish and meat for each dish.
    
    2.3 Compute the balance value by calculating the absolute difference between the total mass of fish and total mass of meat for all dishes.
    
    2.4 Output the minimal balance value that can be achieved.
    
    2.5 Iterate over each dish:
    
        2.5.1 For each dish, determine the grams of fish and meat the taster should eat to minimize the balance.
        
        2.5.2 Output the grams of fish and meat to be eaten from each dish.
        
3. Repeat for all test cases.

4. End the process.
