# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read $n$ and $k$, the length of the string and the number of 1s in the substring.

2. Read the binary string $s$.

3. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of different strings.

4. If $k$ is 0, output 1 as the only string that can be obtained is the original string $s$ itself.

5. Otherwise, loop through all possible substrings of length $k$ that consist of 1s.

6. For each substring, calculate the number of ways to rearrange the 1s within the substring (factorial of the number of 1s in the substring).

7. Multiply the number of ways with the number of ways to rearrange the remaining characters in the string.

8. Increment the counter by the result calculated in the previous step.

9. After looping through all substrings, output the final counter modulo $998244353$ as the number of different strings that can be obtained from $s$ by performing the operation at most once.
