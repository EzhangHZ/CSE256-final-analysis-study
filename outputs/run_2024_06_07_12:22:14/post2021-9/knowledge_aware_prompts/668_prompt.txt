# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases $t$.

2. Loop $t$ times to process each test case.

3. Read $n$ and $m$, the number of vertices and edges in the graph.

4. Read the start and end vertices of the path, $s$ and $t$.

5. Read descriptions of the edges for each test case.

6. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find paths from vertex $s$ to $t$.

7. Consider all paths whose length is at most the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ plus 1.

8. Output the number of paths from $s$ to $t$ satisfying the length criteria, modulo $10^9 + 7$.

9. Repeat for all test cases.

# Problem:

Given an undirected connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The graph contains no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and multiple edges (i.e. no more than one edge between each pair of vertices). The vertices of the graph are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Find the number of paths from a vertex $s$ to $t$ whose length differs from the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ by no more than $1$. Consider all suitable paths, even if they pass through the same vertex or edge more than once (i.e. they are not simple).

Implement the DFS algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Remember to consider the modulo operation to handle large output values.

Graph consisting of $6$ vertices and $8$ edges:

- $6 \rightarrow 1$: Path length is $1$.
- $6 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1$: Path length is $2$.
- $6 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$: Path length is $2$.
- $6 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 1$: Path length is $2$.

There are a total of $4$ matching paths.
