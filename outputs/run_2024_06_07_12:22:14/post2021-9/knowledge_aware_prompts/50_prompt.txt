# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Loop $t$ times to read each test case.

3. Read the number of types of candies, $n$, and the number of candies of each type.

4. Check if there exists a candy type with more candies than half the total sum of candies. If there is, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

5. Initialize a variable to track the previous candy type eaten and set it to $-1$. Initialize a variable to track the maximum number of candies of the current type and set it to $0$.

6. Loop through the types of candies and check if the current type has more candies than the previous maximum. If so, update the maximum and track the current candy type.

7. If the maximum number of candies is greater than one, print "NO" as Vlad would have to eat two candies of the same type in a row.

8. If the maximum number of candies is one for all types, print "YES".

9. End the loop and continue to the next test case.
