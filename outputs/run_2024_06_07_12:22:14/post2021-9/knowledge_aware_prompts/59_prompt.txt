# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of integers in the array $a$.

4. Read n integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ describing the elements of the array $a$.

5. For each test case, calculate the bitwise XOR of all elements in array $a$ to find the value of $x$.

6. Output the value of $x$, as described in the statement.

7. If there are multiple possible values of $x`, output any of them.

8. End of loop.

Now you can use this knowledge-aware prompt to solve the problem efficiently.
