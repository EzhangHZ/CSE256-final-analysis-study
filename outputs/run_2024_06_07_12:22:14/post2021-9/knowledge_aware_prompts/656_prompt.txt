1. Read N and P, the total number of maps in the game and the probability Johnny wants to achieve.

2. Calculate the probability of not playing any of the maps Johnny studied, which is (1 - P).

3. Determine the minimum number of maps Johnny needs to study to achieve the desired probability P. This can be calculated by the formula: $N - \lceil N * (1 - P) \rceil$.

4. Output the minimum number of maps Johnny needs to study.

5. End the process.
