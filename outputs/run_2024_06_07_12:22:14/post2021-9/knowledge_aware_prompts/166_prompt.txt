# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the sequence a.

4. Read the elements of the sequence a and store them in a list.

5. Initialize a counter variable ops to 0 to count the operations.

6. Loop through all pairs of numbers in the sequence and for each pair (a_i, a_j):
     - If a_i equals a_j, change one of them to 0 and increment ops by 1.
     - If a_i is not equal to a_j, change both a_i and a_j to min(a_i, a_j) and increment ops by 2.

7. Print the value of ops as the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 0.

8. End loop.

This prompt is designed to help you efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations required to change all numbers in a given sequence to 0.
