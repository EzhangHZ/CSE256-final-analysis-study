# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the permutation.

4. For each test case, calculate the number of beautiful permutations, which have the property $\gcd(1 \cdot p_1, 2 \cdot p_2, \dots, n \cdot p_n) > 1$.

5. Create a function to calculate the number of beautiful permutations modulo $998\,244\,353$.

6. Use combinatorics and number theory concepts to efficiently count the beautiful permutations.

7. Print the number of beautiful permutations for each test case.

8. End the loop.

Remember to utilize combinatorics, math algorithms, and number theory concepts to devise an efficient solution for counting the beautiful permutations in each test case.
