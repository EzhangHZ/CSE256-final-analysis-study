# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Loop $t$ times to read each test case.

3. Read the coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ of the three vertices of the triangle.

4. Check if it is possible to draw a straight line (horizontal or vertical) to cut the triangle into two non-degenerate triangles.

5. To check if cutting the triangle is possible, look at the relative positions of the vertices:
    - If all the vertices lie on a horizontal line or a vertical line, print "NO" as it is not possible to cut the triangle into two non-degenerate triangles.
    - Otherwise, print "YES" as it is possible to draw a suitable line to cut the triangle.

6. Continue to the next test case.

7. End all loops.
