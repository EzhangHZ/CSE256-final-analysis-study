# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases $t$.

2. Iterate over each test case.

3. Read the dimensions of the grid $n$ and $m$.

4. Check if it is impossible to reach $(n, m)$ directly. If so, print $-1$ and move to the next test case.

5. For reachable cases, calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach $(n, m)$ from $(1, 1)$ without moving in the same direction consecutively.

6. Print the minimum number of moves for each test case.

7. Continue until all test cases are processed.
