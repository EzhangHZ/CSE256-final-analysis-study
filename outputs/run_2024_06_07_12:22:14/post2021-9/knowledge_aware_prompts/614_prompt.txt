# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.
   
2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of elements in the array.

4. Read the array a consisting of n non-negative integers.
   
5. Create an array dp of length n+1, initialized with all zeros.

6. Initialize current value of mex to 0.

7. Loop over each element in the array a.

8. Update dp with the current mex value.

9. Update mex to the maximum of current mex or dp[a[i]].

10. Calculate the number of non-empty MEX-correct subsequences of the given array using dp.

11. Print the calculated result modulo $998244353$.

12. Continue to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
