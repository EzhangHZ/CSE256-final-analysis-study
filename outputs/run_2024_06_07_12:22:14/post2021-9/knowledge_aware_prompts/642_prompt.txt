# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, x, and y, the length of the strings and costs per operation.

4. Read the binary strings a and b, each of length n.

5. Initialize a counter variable for each test case to keep track of the minimum cost needed.

6. Check if the binary strings a and b are equal. If they are, print 0 and move on to the next test case.

7. Initialize a table dp of length n+1, where dp[i] represents the minimum cost needed to make prefixes of length i of a equal to prefixes of length i of b.

8. Apply dynamic programming to update dp table with the minimum cost needed for each prefix.

9. Initialize a greedy algorithm to iterate through indices l and r, updating the minimum cost when necessary based on the prefixes of a and b.

10. If it is not possible to make a equal to b, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum cost needed.

11. End all loops and move to the next test case.

Remember to carefully analyze and design the algorithms to efficiently solve the problem.
