# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and H, the number of available weapons and initial health value of the enemy.

4. Read the damage values of the weapons and store them in a list.

5. Initialize a count variable to 0, representing the minimum number of times the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy.

6. Iterate over the damage values, checking if the last used weapon is the same as the current weapon. If it is, increment the count by 1 and update the last used weapon to a different weapon.

7. Print the final count as the output for each test case.

8. End the loop for all test cases.

9. Implement a binary search algorithm to efficiently search for specific elements in the list of damage values.

10. Utilize the greedy algorithm to choose the best available weapon at each step without considering the long-term impact.

11. Apply mathematical algorithms to perform necessary calculations related to damage values and health value of the enemy.

12. Consider implementing sorting algorithms to arrange data efficiently, such as sorting the damage values in ascending order before processing them for each test case.
