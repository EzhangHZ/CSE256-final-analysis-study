# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate $t$ times to process each test case.

3. Read the number of boxes, $n$.

4. Iterate $n$ times to read the coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ of each box.

5. Calculate the minimum number of moves required to collect all boxes starting from $(0,0)$.

6. For each box at $(x_i, y_i)$:
    - If $x_i > 0$, calculate $x_i$ moves by moving right ($+1$ in $x$ direction).
    - If $x_i < 0$, calculate $-x_i$ moves by moving left ($-1$ in $x$ direction).
    - If $y_i > 0$, calculate $y_i$ moves by moving up ($+1$ in $y$ direction).
    - If $y_i < 0$, calculate $-y_i$ moves by moving down ($-1$ in $y$ direction).

7. Output the total minimum number of moves required for each test case.

8. End all loops.

Implement the above steps to find the minimum number of moves needed to collect all boxes in each test case starting from $(0,0)$.
