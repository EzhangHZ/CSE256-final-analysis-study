# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate through each test case:

    a. Read the even integer $n$.
    
    b. Read the elements of the array $b$ of length $\frac{n}{2}$.
    
    c. Check if there are duplicate elements in $b$. If duplicates exist, print -1 and move to the next test case.
    
    d. Create an empty list $p$ to store the permutation.
    
    e. Set $p[0] = 1$ as the starting point.
    
    f. Iterate over the remaining indices from $1$ to $\frac{n}{2}$:
    
        i. Set $p[2i - 1] = b[i - 1]$ and $p[2i] = 0$.
    
    g. Assign $b_{\text{min}}$ as the minimum value in $b$.
    
    h. Iterate over all indices from 1 to $\frac{n}{2}$:
    
        i. If $p[2i] = 0$, find the smallest number greater than $b_{\text{min}}$ that is not present in $p$ and assign it to $p[2i]$.
    
    i. At this stage, $p$ should contain the lexicographically minimal permutation. Print $p$.
    
3. End of loop over each test case.
