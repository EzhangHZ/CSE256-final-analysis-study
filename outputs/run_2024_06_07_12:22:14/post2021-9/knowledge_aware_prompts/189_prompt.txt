# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the size of the array.

4. Read n integers representing the elements of the array a.

5. Initialize a variable operations to 0 to count the number of operations needed.

6. Loop through the array a starting from index 1.

7. If the current element a[i] is less than the previous element a[i-1], calculate the absolute difference diff = a[i-1] - a[i] and add it to operations.

8. Update the current element a[i] to be greater than or equal to a[i-1].

9. Output the total number of operations needed for each test case.

10. End all loops.

Now, you can implement the solution for the provided problem statement by following the steps outlined above.
