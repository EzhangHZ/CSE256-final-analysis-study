# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read the string s representing the names of capybaras.

4. Since the gardener wrote down the names without spaces, our goal is to split the string s into three distinct strings a, b, and c in a way that satisfies the conditions mentioned.

5. If there exists any way to split s into three strings a, b, and c such that either a ≤ b and c ≤ b or b ≤ a and b ≤ c, print these strings separated by spaces. If multiple solutions exist, print any of them.

6. If it's not possible to split s into three valid strings, print ":(".

7. End all loops and processing steps.
