# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read q, the number of test cases.

2. Loop q times to read each test case.

3. Read the non-empty string s and the non-empty string t.

4. Calculate the minimum number of moves required to remove all occurrences of the string t in string s in the minimum number of moves.

5. Count the number of different optimal sequences of moves that can achieve the minimum number of moves, considering sets of indices at which the removed occurrences of string t in s begin.

6. Output the minimum number of moves and the number of different optimal sequences modulo $10^9 + 7$ for each test case.

7. End all loops.
