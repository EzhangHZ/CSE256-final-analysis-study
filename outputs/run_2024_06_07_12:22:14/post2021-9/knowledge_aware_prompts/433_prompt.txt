# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and k, the length of the binary string and the maximum number of operations allowed.

4. Read the binary string s of length n.

5. Initialize min_sum as the sum of all $d_i$, where $d_i$ are the pair of adjacent elements in the binary string.

6. If k is 0, print min_sum and continue to the next test case.

7. Loop through the binary string and calculate the sum of all $d_i$.

8. If k is less than the number of ones in the binary string, find the positions of 1s and calculate the potential decrease in $f(s)$.

9. Print the minimum value of $f(s)$ that can be achieved with at most k operations.

10. End the loop.
