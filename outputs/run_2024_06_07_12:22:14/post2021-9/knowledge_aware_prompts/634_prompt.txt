# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read s and n, the sum and number of integers to be written on the board.

4. To maximize Alice's sum, iterate from the largest possible number down to 1 and assign it to one of the integers to be written on the board. Update s accordingly.

5. Print the n positive integers on the board that maximize Alice's sum. 

6. End all loops.
