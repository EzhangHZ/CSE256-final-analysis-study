# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate through each test case and perform the following steps:

3. Read the length of the sequence, $n$, and the number of contiguous segments with remembered bitwise OR values, $m$.

4. Iterate over the $m$ segments, each described by $l$, $r$, and $x$, where $l$ is the starting index, $r$ is the ending index, and $x$ is the bitwise OR value.

5. Create a bitmask algorithm to store the set of boolean values corresponding to each element in the sequence.

6. Use combinatorics to count and arrange the subsequences of the sequence to compute the possible coziness values.

7. Implement a constructive algorithm to gradually build the solution by adding elements that satisfy the criteria of the remembered segments.

8. Utilize dynamic programming (dp) techniques to efficiently solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.

9. Apply math algorithms to perform arithmetic calculations, such as bitwise XOR operations and modulo operations.

10. Print the coziness of the sequence modulo $10^9 + 7$ for each test case.

11. End all loops.
