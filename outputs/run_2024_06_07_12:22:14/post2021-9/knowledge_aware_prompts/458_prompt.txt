# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test cases.

3. Read n, the number of bricks.

4. Read the weights of the bricks and store them in a list a.

5. Sort the list a in non-decreasing order.

6. Calculate the maximum possible final score as follows:
    - If n is odd, calculate the score as (a[n//2+1] - a[n//2]) + (a[n//2] - a[n//2-1]).
    - If n is even, calculate the score as (a[n//2] - a[n//2-1]) + (a[n//2+1] - a[n//2]).

7. Repeat steps 2-6 for all test cases.

8. Output the maximum possible final score for each test case.
