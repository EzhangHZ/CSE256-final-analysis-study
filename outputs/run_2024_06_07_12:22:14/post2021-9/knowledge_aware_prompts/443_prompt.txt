# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read q, the number of test cases.

2. Loop q times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of strings s and t.

4. Read string s and string t.

5. Check if the number of 'a's in s is not equal to the number of 'a's in t. If it is not equal, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

6. Check if the number of 'b's in s is not equal to the number of 'b's in t. If it is not equal, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

7. Check if the number of 'c's in s is not equal to the number of 'c's in t. If it is not equal, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

8. Initialize a variable diff to 0.

9. Loop over the characters of s and t simultaneously, if a pair of characters at the same position is not the same, update diff based on the conditions mentioned in the problem.

10. After the loop, if diff is even, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

11. End all loops.
