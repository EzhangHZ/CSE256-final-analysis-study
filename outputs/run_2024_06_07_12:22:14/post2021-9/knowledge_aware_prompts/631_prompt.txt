# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer \( n \), representing the number of sections in the wall.

2. Read the sequence of integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \), where \( a_i \) is the initial durability of the \( i \)-th section.

3. Initialize a variable \( shots \) to 0 to keep track of the total number of onager shots needed.

4. If there are only 2 sections in the wall, print 2 as the minimum number of shots required to break at least two sections and end the prompt.

5. Loop through the sections from the second to the second-to-last section. For each section:
    - Calculate the number of shots needed to break this section and the adjacent sections. The formula is \( \max(0, a_i - a_{i-1} - a_{i+1} + 1) \), where \( a_i \) is the durability of the current section and \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are the durabilities of the adjacent sections.
    - Add this number of shots to the total \( shots \).

6. Print the total \( shots \) as the minimum number of onager shots needed to break at least two sections of the wall and end the prompt.
