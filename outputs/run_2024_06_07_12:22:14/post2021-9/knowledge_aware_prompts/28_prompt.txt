# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the integer for each test case.

4. Check if n is divisible by 7. If it is, print n and move to the next test case.

5. Convert n to a string for easier manipulation.

6. Initialize a variable min_changes as the number of changes needed to make n divisible by 7 and an empty list possible_numbers to store all resulting numbers.

7. Generate all possible combinations of changing digits in n while avoiding leading zeroes. Check each combination to see if it is divisible by 7, and store those numbers in possible_numbers.

8. Print any number from possible_numbers.

9. End all loops.
