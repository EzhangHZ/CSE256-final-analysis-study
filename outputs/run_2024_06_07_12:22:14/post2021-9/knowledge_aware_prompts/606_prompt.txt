# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the depth of the well, `n`.

2. Read the maximum jump heights for each meter below ground level in the form of a list, `a`.

3. Read the distances Gorf will slip down if he takes a break for each meter below ground level in the form of a list, `b`.

4. Implement a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of jumps needed for Gorf to reach ground level.

5. Create a DP array of size `n+1` initialized with a large value, except for the starting position which is set to 0.

6. Iterate over each height below ground level, updating the DP values based on the minimum jumps required to reach that height.

7. Keep track of the jumps taken and the sequence of depths reached before each jump.

8. If Gorf can't reach ground level (DP[n] is still a large value), print `-1`. Otherwise, print the minimum number of jumps needed and the sequence of depths reached before each jump.

9. End the program.

Choose the appropriate algorithm and data structure to efficiently solve the problem of Gorf reaching ground level from a certain depth in the well.
