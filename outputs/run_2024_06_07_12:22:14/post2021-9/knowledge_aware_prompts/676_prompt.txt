# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test cases.

3. Read n, the number of segments.

4. Read the lengths of the n segments and store them in a list a.

5. Initialize a variable curr_min_len to infinity.

6. Initialize a variable curr_end to 0.

7. Loop through each segment length in a:
    - Update curr_end to be the maximum between curr_end - length and curr_end + length.
    - Update curr_min_len to be the minimum between curr_min_len and curr_end.

8. Print curr_min_len as the answer for the test case.

9. End all loops.
