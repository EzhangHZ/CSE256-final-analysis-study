# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the input permutation.

4. Read the sequence b of length n.

5. Initialize an array a of length n to store the final permutation.

6. Determine the threshold k based on the sequence b.

7. Loop through each element x in increasing order from 1 to n.
    
    a. If x is less than or equal to k, set b[x] to the last element a[j] (1 <= j < i) that is greater than k. If no such element exists, set b[x] to n+1.

    b. If x is greater than k, set b[x] to the last element a[j] (1 <= j < i) that is less than or equal to k. If no such element exists, set b[x] to 0.

8. Output the threshold k on the first line.

9. Output the permutation a1, a2, ..., an on the second line.

10. End loop and go to the next test case.
