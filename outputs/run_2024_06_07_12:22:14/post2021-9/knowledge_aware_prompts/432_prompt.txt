# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate over each test case:

    a. Read the number of elements in the array, $n$.
    
    b. Read the array elements as $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$.
    
    c. Initialize an empty array $b$ to store the elements of the maximum array Mihai can create.
    
    d. Define a function to calculate the MEX of a given set of non-negative integers.
    
    e. Loop while $a$ is not empty:
    
        i. Initialize a variable $k$ to $1$.
        
        ii. Find the MEX of the first $k$ elements of $a$.
        
        iii. Add the MEX to array $b$ and remove the chosen elements from $a$.
        
        iv. Increment $k$ and repeat until $a$ is empty.
    
    f. Print the length of the array $b$ followed by the elements of $b$.
    
3. End of loop.

4. End.
