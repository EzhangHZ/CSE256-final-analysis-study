# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer k representing the number of levels in the perfect binary tree.

2. Calculate the number of nodes in the perfect binary tree using the formula $2^k - 1$.

3. Define a function or algorithm to calculate the number of different good colorings of the binary tree modulo $10^9+7$.

4. Implement the rules for coloring the nodes as described in the problem statement: a white node cannot be neighboring with white and yellow nodes, yellow node cannot be neighboring with white and yellow nodes, green node cannot be neighboring with green and blue nodes, blue node cannot be neighboring with green and blue nodes, red node cannot be neighboring with red and orange nodes, and orange node cannot be neighboring with red and orange nodes.

5. Use combinatorial and mathematical algorithms to determine the number of different colorings satisfying the given conditions.

6. Output the result calculated modulo $10^9+7$.

7. Test the algorithm with sample inputs to ensure correctness and efficiency.

8. End the algorithm implementation.
