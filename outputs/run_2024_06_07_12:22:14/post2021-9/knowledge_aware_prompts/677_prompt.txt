# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of vertices in the tree.

4. Loop n-1 times to read the edges x and y between vertices.

5. Identify the hidden vertex x that needs to be found in the tree.

6. Implement a constructive algorithm to determine the minimum number of queries needed to uniquely identify x.

7. Use DFS and similar algorithms to traverse the tree efficiently during the query process.

8. Utilize DP (dynamic programming) techniques if necessary for optimizing the query selection process.

9. Apply greedy heuristic approaches for selecting query vertices efficiently.

10. Utilize tree algorithms to navigate through the tree structure and determine the optimal query strategy.

11. Output the minimum number of queries needed to uniquely identify x for each test case.

12. End all loops and procedures.
