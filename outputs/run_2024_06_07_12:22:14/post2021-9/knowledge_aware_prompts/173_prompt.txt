# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the initial number of tokens.

4. Read n integers representing the initial magical power of the tokens and store them in a list a.

5. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the minimum number of operations needed.

6. Loop through a and for each token:
   - If the token is odd, continue to the next token.
   - If the token is even, increment count by 1.
   - If the token is even, perform reduction operation to make it odd and update the token's value.

7. Print the final value of count for each test case.

8. Repeat for all test cases.

This prompt demonstrates the problem-solving approach using constructive algorithms to help Patchouli minimize the number of operations needed to make all tokens have an odd value of magical power.
