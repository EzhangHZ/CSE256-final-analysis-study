# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer $t$, denoting the number of test cases.

2. Loop through each test case.

3. Read the integer $n$, the length of the array.

4. Read the elements of the array $a$ with length $n$.

5. For each test case, determine if there exist three distinct indices $i$, $j$, $k$ such that $a_i + a_j + a_k$ ends in the digit $3$.

6. Implement a brute force approach to exhaustively search all possible combinations of $i$, $j$, $k$ within the given array.

7. Output "YES" if there exist such distinct indices $i$, $j$, $k$ satisfying the constraint, and "NO" otherwise.

8. Repeat the process for all test cases.
