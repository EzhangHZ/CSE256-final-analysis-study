# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n, the number of rounds.
2. Read the string s of length n containing the symbols appearing in each round.
3. Read q, the number of controllers.
4. Loop q times to read the numbers on the buttons of each controller.
5. For each controller:
    1. Initialize score to 0.
    2. Loop through each round i from 1 to n:
        - If s_i is '+', increase the score by a_j if button a is pressed, else increase by b_j if button b is pressed.
        - If s_i is '-', decrease the score by a_j if button a is pressed, else decrease by b_j if button b is pressed.
    3. If the final score is 0, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".
6. End of loop for each controller.

Remember to handle edge cases and boundary conditions while checking for winnability using each controller.
