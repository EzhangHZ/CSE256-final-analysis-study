# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate through each test case:

    a. Read the number of opponents, Monocarp's initial rating, and desired rating: $n$, $x$, $y$.
    
    b. Read the ratings of Monocarp's opponents: $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.
    
    c. Check if it's possible for Monocarp to reach the desired rating $y$ based on initial rating $x$ and opponents' ratings. If not possible, print -1 and move to the next test case.
    
    d. Implement a strategy to efficiently calculate the minimum number of games Monocarp needs to play to achieve the desired rating $y$, considering the rule of playing against opponents evenly as possible.
    
    e. Print the minimum number of games required for the current test case.
    
3. End of loop.

4. Implement necessary functions and logic to efficiently calculate the minimum number of games Monocarp needs to play and handle the constraints given in the problem statement.

## Knowledge Description:

We can make use of different algorithms and techniques to efficiently solve the problem:

1. Binary search: Utilize binary search for specific scenarios where it can improve performance and optimize the search process within the given constraints.

2. Greedy algorithm: Develop a greedy strategy to guide Monocarp in playing against opponents with the aim of reaching the desired rating $y in the minimum possible number of games.

3. Implementation: Skillfully implement the solution by translating the algorithm into a working program while considering edge cases and ensuring proper integration.

4. Math algorithms: Explore mathematical algorithms to enhance the efficiency of calculating the minimum number of games required, potentially incorporating numerical methods and optimization techniques.

5. Sorting algorithms: Implement sorting algorithms to organize and process data efficiently, facilitating the handling of opponents' ratings and Monocarp's progression towards the desired rating $y.

6. Two pointers technique: Apply the two pointers technique to solve specific challenges within the problem, aiding in searching, partitioning, and manipulating data effectively.

By combining these algorithms and techniques, we can develop an optimized and effective solution to determine the minimum number of games Monocarp needs to play to reach the desired rating $y.
