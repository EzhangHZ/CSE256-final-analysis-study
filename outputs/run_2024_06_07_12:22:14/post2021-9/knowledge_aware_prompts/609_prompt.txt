# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n, the number of vertices of the tree.

2. Read the descriptions of the tree, consisting of n-1 lines with two integers u and v representing the indices of vertices connected by an edge.

3. Read q, the number of queries.

4. Loop q times to process each query.

5. For each query, read k, the size of the set, and k distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pk representing the indices of the vertices in the set.

6. Implement a DFS (depth-first search) algorithm to determine if the set of vertices is passable in the tree.

7. Perform DFS traversal starting from each vertex in the set to check if there exists a path that passes through all vertices of the set without revisiting any edge.

8. Output "YES" if the set is passable, and "NO" otherwise for each query.

9. End all loops.
