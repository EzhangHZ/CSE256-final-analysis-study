# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of members in the group excluding Beppa.

4. Read the list of IDs of members sorted by decreasing times of last seen online at 9:00 and store them in a list a.

5. Read the list of IDs of members sorted by decreasing times of last seen online at 22:00 and store them in a list b.

6. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0.

7. Initialize an empty set online_members.

8. While i < n and j < n:

    a. If a[i] == b[j], increment both i and j.

    b. If a[i] != b[j], add a[i] to online_members and increment i.

9. Print the size of online_members which represents the minimum number of members that must have been online between 9:00 and 22:00.

10. End all loops.
