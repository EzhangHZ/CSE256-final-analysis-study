# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to iterate through each test case.

3. Read n, the width of the grid.

4. Read the string s representing one of the rows of the grid.

5. Based on the provided string of length n and its corresponding half-domino positions, determine the other row of the grid.

6. Output the other row of the grid in the same format as the input string.

7. Repeat the above steps for each test case.

8. End the loop after processing all test cases.

Now, you can use this knowledge-aware prompt to write the code for solving the problem of determining the other row of the grid based on the given input string representing one row.
