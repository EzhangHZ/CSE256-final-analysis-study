# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and m, the number of benches and initial energy.

4. Read the distances a_i between each pair of benches.

5. Initialize energy_needed to 0.

6. Loop through each distance a_i:
   - Calculate the energy needed to travel that distance.
   - If the energy needed is greater than m, calculate the energy to restore to reach the next bench without running out of energy.

7. After the loop, output the total energy_needed for the current test case.

8. Repeat for all test cases.

By implementing the steps above, you will be able to determine the minimum amount of energy you have to restore to reach the final bench in each test case efficiently.
