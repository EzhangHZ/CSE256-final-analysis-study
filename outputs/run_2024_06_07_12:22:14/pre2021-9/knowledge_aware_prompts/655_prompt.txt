# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the size of the chessboard.

4. Read a string of length n representing the initial state of the chessboard.

5. Define a list dp of length n, where dp[i] represents the number of states reachable from the i-th cell.

6. Initialize dp[0] to 1 if the first cell is unoccupied (0), otherwise 0.

7. Loop over the cells from left to right, and update dp[i] based on the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

8. Calculate the total number of states reachable from the initial state using the calculated dp array and modulo $998,244,353$.

9. Print the result for each test case.

10. End all loops.
