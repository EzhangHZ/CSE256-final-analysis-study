# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read l, r, and m for each test case.

4. Calculate the possible values of a, b, and c:
   - Start by assuming a = l, b = l, and c = l.
   - Loop through a in the range [l, r] and for each a, calculate b and c such that n = (m - b + c) / a is a strictly positive integer.
   - If such n is found, output the values of a, b, and c.
   - If no such n is found for the current a, increment a and repeat the process.
   
5. Output the values of a, b, and c that satisfy the given conditions.

6. End the loop after processing all test cases.

This prompt requires the understanding of math and brute force algorithms to iteratively search for the values of a, b, and c that satisfy the mathematical equation given the constraints.
