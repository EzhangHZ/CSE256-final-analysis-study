1. Read t, the number of regular polygons available in the market.

2. Loop t times to read each regular polygon.

3. Read the number of sides n for each regular polygon.

4. For each regular polygon, check if it's a beautiful regular polygon:
   - A regular n-sided polygon is considered beautiful if it can be rotated such that at least one edge is parallel to the x-axis and at least one edge is parallel to the y-axis at the same time.
