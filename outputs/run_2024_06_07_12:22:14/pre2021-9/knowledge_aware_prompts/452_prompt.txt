# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer n which signifies the number of elements in Kolya's array.

2. Read the n integers representing Kolya's array into a list.

3. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the minimum number of integers that need to be inserted.

4. Loop through each pair of adjacent elements in the array and check if the sum of the subsegment equals 0.

5. If the sum of the subsegment equals 0, calculate the absolute difference between the adjacent elements in the pair and increment the count by that difference.

6. After iterating through all pairs of elements, print the final value of count as the minimum number of integers needed to be inserted into Kolya's array.

7. End the process.

Now you have a structured approach to help Kolya with his array modification request.
