# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.
2. Iterate over each test case.
3. Read the length of the song, n, and the sequence of integers representing the notes.
4. Create a set to store unique elements in the sequence.
5. Initialize a variable to count the number of elements to be increased for maximal diversity.
6. Iterate over the sequence of notes:
   - If the current element is already in the set, increment the count of elements to be increased.
   - Otherwise, add the current element to the set.
7. Output the total number of unique elements in the sequence plus the count of elements to be increased.

Now it's your turn to implement this problem-solving prompt!
