# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of candies received by Alice and Bob.

4. Read the weights of the n candies and store them in a list a.

5. Check if the total weight of candies can be evenly divided by 2. If not, print "NO" and move to the next test case.

6. Define a variable 'totalWeight' to store the sum of weights of all candies.

7. Loop through all candies and calculate the total weight.

8. If the total weight is odd, print "NO" because equal division is not possible.

9. Else, apply a greedy algorithm to redistribute the candies such that both Alice and Bob have equal total weights. If possible, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

10. End all loops.
