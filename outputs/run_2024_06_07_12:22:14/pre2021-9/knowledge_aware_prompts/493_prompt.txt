# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integers $n$ and $k$, representing the number of cities and industry cities, respectively.

2. Read the details of the $n-1$ roads connecting the cities.

3. Construct a tree data structure based on the given roads.

4. Implement a DFS (depth-first search) algorithm to traverse the tree and calculate the sum of happinesses for all envoys.

5. Keep track of the number of tourism cities on each envoy's path and compute their cumulative happiness.

6. As Linova plans to choose exactly $k$ cities for industry development, focus on selecting the optimal $k$ cities that maximize the sum of happinesses.

7. Utilize dynamic programming (DP) to store intermediate results and optimize the solution for selecting the industry cities.

8. Output the maximum possible sum of happinesses of all envoys based on the chosen cities for industry development.

9. Consider using greedy algorithms and sorting techniques for further optimization if necessary.

10. End all loops and algorithms to finalize the queen's decision on city development strategy.
