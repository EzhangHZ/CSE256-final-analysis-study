# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, l, r, and s for each test case.

4. Check if it is possible to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n that satisfies the condition. If it's not possible, print -1 and move to the next test case.

5. If it's possible, find any permutation p that fits the condition, where $s = p_l + p_{l+1} + \ldots + p_r$.

6. Output the permutation p on a separate line.

7. End all loops.
