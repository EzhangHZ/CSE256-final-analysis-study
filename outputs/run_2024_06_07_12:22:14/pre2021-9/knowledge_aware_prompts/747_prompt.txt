# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and m, the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

4. Read the initial values of nodes and target values of nodes.

5. Read the edges connecting the nodes.

6. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a node and iterate through the connected nodes.

7. Use the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently keep track of disjoint subsets.

8. Use constructive algorithms to gradually build a solution to reach the target values for each node.

9. If it is possible for every node to reach its target after some number of operations, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

10. End all loops and procedures.
