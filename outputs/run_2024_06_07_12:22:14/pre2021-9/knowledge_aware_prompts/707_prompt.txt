# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and k, the length of lists and the minimum required total intersection.

4. Read l1 and r1, the initial segment for [al_i, ar_i].

5. Read l2 and r2, the initial segment for [bl_i, br_i].

6. Check if the initial total intersection I is already greater or equal to k. If it is, print "0" and continue to the next test case.

7. Calculate the minimum number of steps needed to make I greater or equal to k by extending the segments in the lists. Keep track of the sum of lengths of intersections of corresponding pairs of segments.

8. Print the minimum number of steps needed for each test case.

9. End all loops.
