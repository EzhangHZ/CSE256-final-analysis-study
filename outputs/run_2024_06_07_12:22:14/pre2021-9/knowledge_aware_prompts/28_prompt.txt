# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and m, the length of the array and its sum respectively.

4. If n is 1, print 0 and continue to the next test case.

5. If n is 2, print min(2, m) and continue to the next test case.

6. If n is greater than 2, first fill the array with 1s and then distribute the remaining sum (m - n) across the array indexes starting from the second one. To maximize the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements, alternate the values (increase, decrease, increase, decrease...).

7. Calculate the maximum possible value of $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} |a_i - a_{i+1}|$ for the constructed array a.

8. Print the answer calculated in step 7 for each test case.

9. End all loops.
