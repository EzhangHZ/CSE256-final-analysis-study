# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read $q$, the number of test cases.

2. Loop $q$ times to read each test case.

3. Read strings $s$ and $t$.

4. Check if the length of string $t$ is within the range $[1, 2 \cdot |s| - 1]$. If not, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

5. Implement a brute force approach to check if it's possible to obtain string $t$ from string $s$ following the described operations.

6. Check all possible positions to place the chip on string $s$ and perform the operations to check if string $t$ can be obtained.

7. If it's possible to obtain string $t`, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

8. End all loops.

Now, you can provide more examples or discuss the implementation details for this problem.
