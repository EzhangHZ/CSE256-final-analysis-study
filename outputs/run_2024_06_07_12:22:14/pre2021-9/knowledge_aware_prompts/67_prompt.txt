# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of reviewers in the testcase.

4. Read the types of reviewers as r1, r2, ..., rn in the same order they entered the site.

5. Initialize count_first_server and count_second_server as 0, representing the total number of upvotes each server can gather.

6. Loop through each reviewer type:
    - If the reviewer is of type 1, increment count_first_server by 1.
    - If the reviewer is of type 2, increment count_second_server by 1.
    - If the reviewer is of type 3, check which server has more downvotes and send the reviewer to that server. Then increment the respective server's count by 1.

7. Calculate the total maximum number of upvotes by adding count_first_server and count_second_server.

8. Print the total maximum number of upvotes for each testcase.

9. End the loop.

10. Move to the next testcase or finish the program.

Remember, as a movie director, your goal is to maximize the number of upvotes for your movie by strategically sending reviewers to the servers.
