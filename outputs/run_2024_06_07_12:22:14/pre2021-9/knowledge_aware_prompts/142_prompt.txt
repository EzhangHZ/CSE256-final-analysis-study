# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of daughters, necklaces, and bracelets.

4. Read the brightnesses of the necklaces and store them in an array a.

5. Read the brightnesses of the bracelets and store them in an array b.

6. Create two empty arrays x and y to store the brightnesses of necklaces and bracelets for each daughter.

7. Sort the arrays a and b in non-decreasing order.

8. Assign the smallest value of a to the first daughter, and the smallest value of b to the second daughter. Continue this assignment in a constructive manner to ensure the sums x_i + y_i are pairwise distinct.

9. Print the brightnesses of the necklaces for each daughter in array x.

10. Print the brightnesses of the bracelets for each daughter in array y.

11. Repeat steps 2-10 for all test cases.

This prompt utilizes the knowledge of constructive algorithms, sorting, and arrays to efficiently distribute the gifts to Kuroni's daughters while ensuring the uniqueness of total brightnesses received by each daughter.
