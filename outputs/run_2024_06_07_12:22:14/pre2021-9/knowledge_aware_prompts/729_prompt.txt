# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the total number of skyscrapers, n.
  
2. Read the heights of n skyscrapers and store them in a list h.

3. Initialize a variable count to 1 to keep track of the number of discrete jumps.

4. Loop from the first skyscraper (index 0) to the second last skyscraper (index n-2).

5. For each pair of consecutive skyscrapers (i, i+1):
    - If the condition max(h[i+1], ..., h[j-1]) < min(h[i], h[j]) or max(h[i], h[j]) < min(h[i+1], ..., h[j-1]) is satisfied, increment count by 1.

6. Print the value of count as the minimal amount of discrete jumps required.

7. End the loop.

This prompt combines knowledge of data structures, dynamic programming (DP), and graphs to efficiently determine the minimal number of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper while considering the heights of the buildings in New York.
