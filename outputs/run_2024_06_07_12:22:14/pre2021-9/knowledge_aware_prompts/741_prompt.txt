# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1.Read t, the number of test cases.

2.Loop t times to read each test case.

3.Read n, the position of the element to find in the infinite sequence.

4.Implement a method to generate the infinite sequence $s$ by finding the lexicographically smallest triple of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ such that $a \oplus b \oplus c = 0$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

5.Generate and store the elements of the infinite sequence $s$ up to the $n$-th index.

6.Output the $n$-th element for each test case.

7.End all loop.
