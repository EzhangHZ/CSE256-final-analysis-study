# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the sequence.

4. Read n integers representing the sequence and store them in a list.

5. Calculate the length of the longest almost increasing subsequence for each test case.

6. Use the concept of dynamic programming (dp) to solve the problem efficiently.

7. Implement the dp algorithm to find the longest almost increasing subsequence.

8. Consider using data structures like arrays or lists to store intermediate results.

9. Greedy algorithm can also be considered as a heuristic approach for optimization in this problem context.

10. Output the length of the longest almost increasing subsequence for each test case.

11. End all loops and computations.

Do you need any further clarification or details on the implementation?
