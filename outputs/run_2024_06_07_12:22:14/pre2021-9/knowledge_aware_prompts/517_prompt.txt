# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer $n$.

2. Initialize a list $subseq$ to store the longest subsequence.

3. Loop from $1$ to $n-1$, calculate the product $p = (p \times i) \% n$ where $p$ is the current product.

4. Check if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ and keep track of the length and elements of the subsequence that leads to $p \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

5. Output the length of the longest subsequence found and the elements in increasing order.

6. End.

You may use either the greedy algorithm or number theory to approach this problem.
