# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer $n$, representing the length of the array $a$.

2. Read the array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers.

3. Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum total number of segments for both $a^{(0)}$ and $a^{(1)}$.

4. Construct a constructive algorithm to find the optimal painting assignment $b$ that minimizes the total number of segments in both $a^{(0)}$ and $a^{(1)}$.

5. Implement a greedy approach to iteratively select the best color to paint each element of the array $a$.

6. Output a single integer representing the minimal possible total number of segments achieved by the optimal painting assignment.

7. End the program.

Remember to consider efficient data structures and dynamic programming techniques if necessary while developing your algorithm for the problem.
