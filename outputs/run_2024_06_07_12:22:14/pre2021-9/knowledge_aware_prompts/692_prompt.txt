# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n, m, and k, the number of rows, columns in the grid, and the total distance Bashar wants to run.

2. Check if the total distance Bashar wants to run is greater than the total number of roads in the grid. If it is, print "NO" and end.

3. Implement a graph-based constructive algorithm approach to generate a sequence of moves for Bashar to run exactly k kilometers without visiting the same road twice.

4. Start Bashar at the top-left cell of the grid and create a sequence of steps using up (U), down (D), left (L), and right (R) moves. Ensure Bashar does not go outside the grid and finishes at any cell.

5. If a valid sequence of steps is generated, print "YES" on the first line, followed by the number of steps (a) and the details of each step.

6. Output "NO" if it is impossible for Bashar to run exactly k kilometers in the given grid.

7. Ensure the total number of steps does not exceed 3000 for Bashar's convenience in remembering the moves.
