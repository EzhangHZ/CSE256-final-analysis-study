# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer n, the number of nodes in the tree.

2. Read and construct the tree by reading n-1 edges between nodes u and v.

3. Implement a recursive DFS algorithm to traverse the tree and label the edges. Assign the label to each edge based on conditions to minimize the largest MEX(u,v).

4. Output n-1 integers, representing the number written on each edge in the input order.

5. Design the algorithm with constructive methodology to gradually build the optimal solution for labeling the tree's edges.

6. You can leverage DFS and similar algorithms to efficiently traverse the tree structure and assign labels to the edges.

7. Utilize the greedy algorithm to make locally optimal choices at each step for labeling the edges of the tree.

8. Ensure that all written labels are distinct and within the range of 0 to n-2 inclusive.

9. Handle the tree data structure efficiently to optimize the labeling process and minimize the largest MEX(u,v).

10. End the algorithm to output the labeled edges for the tree dataset.
