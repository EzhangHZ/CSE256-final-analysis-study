# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:
    a. Read the number of vertices, n, and edges, m.
    b. Read the descriptions of m edges and store them.
    c. Construct the directed graph based on the given edges.

3. Implement a function using DFS to traverse the graph and determine the number of paths from vertex 1 to all other vertices.
    a. Return 0 if there are no paths from 1 to v.
    b. Return 1 if there is only one path from 1 to v.
    c. Return 2 if there are multiple finite paths from 1 to v.
    d. Return -1 if there are infinite paths from 1 to v (handling loops).

4. Output the results of each test case, printing a sequence of n integers ranging from -1 to 2.

5. Repeat for all t test cases.

6. End the process.
