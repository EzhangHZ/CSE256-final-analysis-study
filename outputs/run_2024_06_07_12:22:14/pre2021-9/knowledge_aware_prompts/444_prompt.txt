# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate over each test case:

   a. Read the resulting binary string, $s$, and the integer $x$.
   
   b. Initialize an empty string $w$ of length equal to $|s|$.
   
   c. Loop through each character position $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$:
   
      - Determine the value of $w_{i}$ based on the conditions provided.
   
   d. If a valid string $w$ can be reconstructed, print $w$; otherwise, print $-1$.

3. End of loop.

4. Suggested algorithmic approaches for reconstructing the binary string $w$ may include brute force methods or constructive algorithms. 

5. Consider using a greedy approach or 2-SAT algorithm depending on the complexities involved. 

6. Implement the solution considering the constraints and the nature of the problem.

7. End of prompt.
