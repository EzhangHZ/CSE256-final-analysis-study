# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and m, the number of vertices in the graph and the length of the palindrome path.

4. Read the characters describing the edges between the vertices and store them in a 2D list.

5. Iterate through all pairs of vertices (u, v) where u != v to check if there exists a palindrome path of length m starting from vertex u and ending at vertex v.

6. Use a brute force approach to try all possible paths of length m between each pair of vertices and check if the path forms a palindrome.

7. If a palindrome path of length m is found, print "YES" followed by the indices of vertices in the path in the appropriate order. If multiple valid paths exist, print any of them.

8. If no palindrome path of length m is found between any pair of vertices, print "NO".

9. End loop.
