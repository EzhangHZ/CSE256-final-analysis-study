# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer t, denoting the number of test cases.

2. Loop over each test case and read the integers n and k, representing the length of sequence a and its maximum, respectively.

3. Check if within the range k $\leq$ n < 2k and if k $\leq$ $10^5$ holds true. If not, proceed to the next test case.

4. Create a sequence a according to the description.

5. Construct a permutation p of size k that maximizes sequence b lexicographically, considering the total number of inversions.

6. Output the permutation p for each test case.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 for all test cases.

8. End all loops.
