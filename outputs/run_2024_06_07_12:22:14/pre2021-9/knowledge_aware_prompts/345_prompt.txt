# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read a, b, n, and m - the number of vanilla cookies, chocolate cookies, guests of the first type, and guests of the second type respectively.

4. Check if each test case input satisfies the conditions (0 ≤ a, b, n, m ≤ 10^18, and n + m ≠ 0). If not, skip that test case.

5. Implement a greedy algorithm to determine if there exists a valid order of guests such that no guest gets angry.

6. For each guest, calculate the type of cookie they choose based on the current number of vanilla and chocolate cookies.

7. If there is at least one cookie of the selected type, let the guest eat one cookie. Otherwise, return "No" as the guest will get angry.

8. Continue this process for all guests in a given order.

9. If all guests can eat cookies without getting angry, print "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, print "No".

10. Repeat this process for all test cases.

11. End.
