# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of friends, and a list of integers a representing the number of candies each friend has.

4. Calculate the total sum of candies in the list a.

5. Check if the total sum divided by n leaves a remainder. If there is a remainder, print "-1" and continue to the next test case.

6. Calculate the target number of candies each friend should have, which is the total sum divided by n.

7. Initialize k (minimum value of friends needed to redistribute candies) to 0.

8. Loop through the list a and increment k by 1 for each friend whose number of candies is not equal to the target number.

9. Print the final value of k for the current test case.

10. End all loops.
