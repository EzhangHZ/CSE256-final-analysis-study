1. Read q, the number of queries.

2. Loop q times to process each query.

3. If the query is of type 1, read the amount of money m estimated by Polycarp.

4. Maintain two data structures: a queue for customers who haven't been served yet and a priority queue for customers based on the amount of money they are expected to spend.

5. If the query is of type 2 (Monocarp serves the first customer), dequeue the customer from the front of the queue and print their number.

6. If the query is of type 3 (Polycarp serves the customer expected to spend the most money), dequeue customers from the priority queue until finding the first one also present in the waiting queue. Print the number of the served customer.

7. End all loops.
