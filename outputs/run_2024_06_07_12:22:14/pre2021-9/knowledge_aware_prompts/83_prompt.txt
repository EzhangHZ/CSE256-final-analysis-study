# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read px and py, the coordinates of Planetforces.

4. Read the list of orders s.

5. Initialize variables x and y to 0.

6. Loop through each character in s:
   - If the character is "U", increment y by 1.
   - If the character is "D", decrement y by 1.
   - If the character is "R", increment x by 1.
   - If the character is "L", decrement x by 1.

7. Calculate the remaining distance to reach Planetforces by subtracting px from x and py from y. Let dx = px - x and dy = py - y.

8. Check if it is possible to delete some orders from s to adjust the final position x and y to reach Planetforces.
   - If dx is positive, check if 'R' orders can be deleted to reduce dx.
   - If dx is negative, check if 'L' orders can be deleted to reduce dx.
   - If dy is positive, check if 'U' orders can be deleted to reduce dy.
   - If dy is negative, check if 'D' orders can be deleted to reduce dy.

9. If it is possible to delete orders and reach Planetforces, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

10. End all loops.
