# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and m, the lengths of the two arrays.

4. Read n integers representing the first array elements and store them in a list a.

5. Read m integers representing the second array elements and store them in a list b.

6. Initialize a variable flag to check if a solution exists, initially set to False.

7. Loop over all possible subsequences of a with increasing lengths starting from 1.

8. For each subsequence of a, check if it is also a subsequence of b. If yes, set flag to True and break the loop.

9. If flag is True, print "YES" and the length of the subsequence followed by the subsequence elements. If there are multiple solutions with the smallest length, print any.

10. If flag is False after checking all subsequences, print "NO" indicating that there is no solution.

11. End of loop.
