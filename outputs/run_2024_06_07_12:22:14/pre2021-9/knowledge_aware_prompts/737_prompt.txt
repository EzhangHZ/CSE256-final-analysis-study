# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n and M, the number of computers and the modulo.

2. Define an array dp of length n to store the number of ways to turn on the computers in each state.

3. Initialize dp[0] and dp[1] with 1 since there is only one way to turn on the first and second computers.

4. Loop i from 2 to n-1, calculate dp[i] using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % M.

5. Calculate the total number of ways to turn on all computers as (dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]) % M.

6. Print the total number of ways modulo M as the output.

7. End the loop.
