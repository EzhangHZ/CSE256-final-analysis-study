# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the input integer $n$, denoting the number of elements in the multiset.

2. Read the second line containing $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, representing the initial count of each element in the multiset.

3. Determine the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset.

4. Apply two types of operations as described:
   - Operation 1: Choose two integers $l$ and $r$, then remove one occurrence of $l$, one occurrence of $l + 1$, ..., one occurrence of $r$ from the multiset.
   - Operation 2: Choose two integers $i$ and $x$, then remove $x$ occurrences of $i$ from the multiset.

5. Output the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset.

6. Analyze the problem using data structures, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms to optimize the solution.

7. Efficiently design a solution based on the knowledge of data structures and algorithms mentioned above to tackle the problem of deleting all elements from the multiset with minimum operations.
