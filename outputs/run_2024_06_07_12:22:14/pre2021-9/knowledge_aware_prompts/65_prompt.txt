# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the binary string.

4. Read the binary string s of length 2n-1 and store it.

5. For each test case, construct a binary string w of length n that is similar to all substrings of s.

6. To construct w, compare each substring of length n from s[1..n] to s[n..2n-1], finding the common characters.

7. Assemble w with the common characters found in step 6. If there are multiple possible strings, output any of them.

8. Output the constructed binary string w for each test case.

9. Repeat for all test cases.
