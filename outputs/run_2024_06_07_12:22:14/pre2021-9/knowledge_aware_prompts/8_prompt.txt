# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the integer t, denoting the number of test cases.

2. Iterate t times to process each test case.

3. Read the integer k for each test case.

4. Initialize a variable count to 0.

5. Start a loop to generate positive integers that Polycarp likes:
   - Increment count by 1 in each iteration.
   - Check if count is not divisible by 3 and does not end with the digit 3.
   - If the conditions are met, increment the sequence number by 1.

6. Once the k-th element in the sequence is generated, print it.

7. Repeat the process for each test case.

8. End all loops.
