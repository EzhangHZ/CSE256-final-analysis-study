# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read x, y, and z, the three positive integers.

4. Check if (x + y + z) % 2 is not zero, print "NO" and continue to the next test case.

5. Calculate a as (x + y - z) / 2, b as (x + z - y) / 2, and c as (y + z - x) / 2.

6. Check if a, b, and c are all positive integers, if so print "YES" followed by any valid triple of positive integers a, b, and c in any order; otherwise, print "NO".

7. End all loops.
