# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read integers n and m, indicating the lengths of arrays a and b respectively.

2. Read array a, consisting of n integers.

3. Read array b, sorted in ascending order and containing m integers.

4. Initialize a counter variable ways to keep track of the number of ways to divide the array a.

5. Implement a constructive algorithm to determine the number of ways to divide array a into m consecutive subarrays satisfying the conditions mentioned.

6. Start by considering each of the subarrays formed by array b. For each subarray with minimum element b_i, find the number of ways to divide the corresponding section of array a.

7. Utilize combinatorics to calculate the total number of ways by multiplying the ways for each subarray.

8. Print the final count modulo 998244353 as the output.

9. Make sure to consider edge cases and corner cases while implementing the solution.

10. End the algorithm and output the result.
