# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the initial amount of planks at the company's storehouse, denoted as $n$.

2. Read the lengths of the planks stored at the company's storehouse.

3. Read the number of events in the company, denoted as $q$.

4. Loop $q$ times to process each event description.

5. For each event, determine if the required shape storages can be built from the planks available at the storehouse after the event.

6. Output "YES" if two storages of the required shape can be built, and "NO" otherwise after each event.

7. Implement the calculations after each event to analyze the availability of planks for building the required storages.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for all events in the company.

9. End the process.

Using the provided knowledge description, consider utilizing constructive algorithms, data structures, greedy algorithm, and efficient implementation strategies to construct the solution for Applejack's scenario of building square and rectangular storages.
