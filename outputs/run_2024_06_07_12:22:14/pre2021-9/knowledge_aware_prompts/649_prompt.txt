# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n, the length of the string.
2. Read the string s of length n.
3. Initialize a variable swaps to 0 to keep track of the number of swaps needed.
4. Loop through the first half of the string (n//2 times).
5. Compare the characters at positions i and n-i-1. If they are not equal, increment swaps by abs(i - (n-i-1)).
6. Print the value of swaps as the minimum number of swaps required to reverse the string.
