# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of vertices in the tree.

4. Read the weights of each vertex and store them in a list.

5. Read n-1 edges connecting the vertices to form the tree.

6. Implement data structures to represent the tree, such as adjacency list or tree data structure.

7. For each k from 1 to n-1, calculate the maximal value of a k-coloring of the tree.

8. Use greedy algorithms to optimize the assignment of colors to edges for each k-value.

9. Calculate the value of connected components and subgraphs based on the assigned colors.

10. Print the maximal value of a k-coloring for each k in a single line separated by spaces for each test case.

11. End all loops and output the results.

This prompt involves utilizing data structures to represent the tree, implementing greedy algorithms for optimization, and applying sorting techniques to solve the maximal value of a k-coloring problem in tree structures.
