# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the length of the string level, and the string representing the level.

4. Initialize a variable to count the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level.

5. Start from the left end of the string and find the first sheep position and its index.

6. Move all subsequent sheep to the right, increasing the move count by the difference between the current sheep's index and the previous one.

7. Continue this process until all sheep are lined up in the string level.

8. Print the total number of moves needed to complete the level for each test case.

9. End all loops.
