# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of elements in the array and the values for each element.

4. Calculate the prefix sum of the array and store it in a list.

5. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the minimum number of operations needed.

6. Iterate over the prefix sum list and check for the minimum number of operations required based on the absolute differences between adjacent elements.

7. If changing one integer in the array can reduce the number of operations, consider that option.

8. Print the minimum number of operations required for each test case.

9. End all loops and processing.
