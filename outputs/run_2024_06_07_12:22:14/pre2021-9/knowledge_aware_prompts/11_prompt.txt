# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of days Polycarp solved tasks.

4. Read the string of length n, representing the order in which Polycarp solved the tasks.

5. Initialize a set called "solved" to keep track of tasks solved on previous days.

6. Initialize a boolean variable "suspicious" to False.

7. Loop through each day from 1 to n.

8. Check if the current task is already in the "solved" set:
   - If it is, set "suspicious" to True and break out of the loop.
   - If not, add the current task to the "solved" set.

9. After the loop, if "suspicious" is True, print "NO"; otherwise, print "YES".

10. End all loops.
