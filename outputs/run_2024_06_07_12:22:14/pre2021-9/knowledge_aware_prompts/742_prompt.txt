# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n and k, representing the sum of digits and the step size.

4. Initialize a variable min_x to store the minimum x value meeting the constraint, initially set to -1.

5. Implement a brute force algorithm to find the smallest non-negative integer x such that the sum of digits from x to x+k equals n.

6. For each candidate x, calculate f(x) + f(x+1) + ... + f(x+k) and compare it with the given n.

7. If the sum matches n, update min_x if the current x is smaller.

8. Output the minimum x that meets the constraint or -1 if no such x exists.

9. End all loops.
