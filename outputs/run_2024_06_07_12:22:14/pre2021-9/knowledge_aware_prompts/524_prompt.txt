# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. Iterate t times to process each test case.

3. Read the values of n, the number of elements in the sequence, and x, the initial value.

4. Read the sequence of n integers, a.

5. Initialize a counter for the minimum number of operations needed to sort the sequence.

6. Create a sorted version of a, sorted_a, to keep track of the expected sorted sequence.

7. Loop through each element, compare it with the corresponding element in sorted_a, and perform the necessary swaps if the element is greater than x.

8. Check if the sequence is impossible to sort (i.e., if an element cannot be placed in the correct position). If so, set the minimum operations to -1 and break out of the loop.

9. If the sequence is sortable, increment the minimum operations counter for each swap.

10. Output the minimum number of operations needed to sort the sequence or -1 if it is impossible.

11. End all loops.
