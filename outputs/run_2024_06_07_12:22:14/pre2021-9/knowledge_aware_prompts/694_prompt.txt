# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. Loop t times to read each test case.

3. Read n, the number of points to visit.

4. Read the list of positions r and c for n points in the triangle.

5. Create a graph that represents the connections between points in the triangle, based on the activation of edges.

6. Implement a shortest path algorithm to find the minimum cost path passing through all points in arbitrary order.

7. Output the minimum cost of the path for each test case.

8. Repeat for all test cases.
