# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases, $t$.

2. Iterate over each test case and read the values of $n$, $k$, and $m$.

3. Read the sequence $b$ of length $m$.

4. Check if $m$ is greater than $n$, if so, print "NO" and move on to the next test case.

5. If $m$ is equal to $n$, check if the sequence $b$ is the same as the original sequence $[1, 2, \dots, n]$, if so, print "YES", else print "NO".

6. If $m$ is less than $n$, calculate the maximum number of elements that can be removed in one step, let's call it $max\_remove$.

7. Iterate over the elements in $b$ and keep track of the count of elements that are not marked for removal.

8. At each step while iterating over elements in $b$, check if the number of elements that can be removed without erasing the median is less than the current element in $b$. If so, print "NO" and move on to the next test case.

9. If the iteration completes successfully without encountering a case where it's impossible to achieve the desired sequence $b$, print "YES" for the current test case.

10. Move on to the next test case and repeat the process.

Now, you can proceed with solving the problem using the provided knowledge to create the solution algorithm.
