# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases $t$.

2. Loop $t$ times to process each test case.

3. Read the number of positions $n$ and the cost of a new computer $c$.

4. Read the daily earnings array $a$ with $n$ integers.

5. Read the online course cost array $b$ with $n - 1$ integers.

6. Initialize a variable days = 0 to track the number of days taken.

7. Initialize a variable balance = 0 to track Polycarp's balance.

8. Loop over each position from 1 to $n$:
   - If Polycarp can earn tugriks that day, add to the balance.
   - If Polycarp can move to the next position and has enough balance, deduct the course cost and move to the next position.

9. Repeat step 8 until the balance is less than the cost of a new computer $c$.

10. Output the total number of days taken to buy a new computer.

11. End of loop.

You can use the concepts of "brute force," "dp," "greedy," or "implementation" to optimize the solution further based on the constraints and requirements of the problem.
