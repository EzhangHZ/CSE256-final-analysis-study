# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read n, the number of bosses, and k, the number of resets allowed.

2. Read the point increments of the n bosses and store them in a list c.

3. Initialize variables max_score and temp_score to track the maximum score and temporary score.

4. Loop through each boss:
    a. Calculate the temporary score by adding the boss bonus to Wabbit's score.
    b. Update the boss bonus by adding the point increment of the current boss.
    
5. If k is greater than 0, consider the possibility of resetting:
    a. Loop through each boss again:
        i. Calculate the temporary score by adding the boss bonus to Wabbit's score.
        ii. Update the boss bonus by adding the point increment of the current boss.
        iii. If the temporary score is greater than the max_score, update max_score.
        iv. Reset the boss bonus to 0.
   
6. Print the maximum score, max_score, that Wabbit can obtain by defeating all n bosses.

7. End the loop and output the result.
