# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases $t$.

2. Loop $t$ times to process each test case.

3. Read the integer $n$, the number of bags with candies.

4. For each test case, construct a valid sequence of operations to make all bags contain an equal amount of candies.

5. Determine the number of operations $m$ needed.

6. Output $m$ on the first line followed by $m$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$, where $a_j$ represents the bag chosen for the $j$-th operation.

7. End all loops.

8. Along the process, use constructive algorithms to build the sequence of operations step-by-step until all bags contain an equal number of candies.

9. Math algorithms may be used to calculate the total number of candies added during each operation efficiently.

# Problem:

You are given $n$ bags with candies, where the $i$-th bag initially contains $i$ candies. Your task is to create a sequence of operations to equalize the number of candies in all bags.

Each operation involves choosing one bag and adding a specific amount of candies to all other bags.

You need to find a valid sequence of operations for each test case such that the candies in all bags are equal in the end.

-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line of input contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$).

The subsequent lines of each test case contain a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) representing the number of bags.

-----Output-----

For each test case, print two lines:

1. The number of operations $m$ and the sequence of operations denoted by $m$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$.

2. The sequence of operations specifies which bag to choose for each operation.

-----Examples-----

Input
2
2
3
Output
1
2
5
3 3 3 1 2

-----Note-----

In the first case, adding $1$ candy to all bags except the second one leads to the final arrangement of $[2, 2]$ candies.

In the second case, you perform multiple operations to achieve the equalization of candies in all bags by choosing specific bags and adding the correct number of candies.
