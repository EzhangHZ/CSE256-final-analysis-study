# Knowledge-Aware Prompt:

1. Read the number of test cases $t$.
   
2. Iterate over each test case and perform the following steps:
   
   - Read the integers $a$, $b$, and $k$, representing the number of boys, girls, and pairs ready to dance.
   
   - Read the pair numbers of boys and girls for each pair.
   
   - Create a dictionary or a data structure to store the counts of each boy and girl present in the pairs.
   
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pair combinations.
   
   - Iterate over the pairs and calculate the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition of no person being in more than one pair.
   
       - For each pair, check the number of combinations that can be formed without repeating individuals.
   
       - Update the counter with the calculated number of combinations.
   
   - Output the final count of valid pair combinations for the test case.
   
3. Repeat the process for all test cases.

4. End the prompt.

Remember to efficiently handle the constraints of the input parameters such as the number of test cases, boys, girls, pairs, and the total sum of these values. Implement logic to calculate the valid pair combinations based on combinatorial principles.
