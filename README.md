# CSE256 Final Analysis Study: Reproducing KareCoder

This is an attempt to reproduce the [KareCoder](https://github.com/CodeGeneration3/KareCoder) project.

## File Structure

- `KareCoder-main` is the dataset source code from [KareCoder](https://github.com/CodeGeneration3/KareCoder). This repo omitted it to save space.
- `.env` contains the OpenAI API key. It's omitted for security purpose.
- `outputs/` contains the generated knowledge-aware prompts and the solution codes.
- `code.ipynb` is the main code for KareCoder reproduction.
