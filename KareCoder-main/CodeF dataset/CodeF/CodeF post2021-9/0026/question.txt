Luca has a cypher made up of a sequence of $n$ wheels, each with a digit $a_i$ written on it. On the $i$-th wheel, he made $b_i$ moves. Each move is one of two types:

up move (denoted by ${U}$): it increases the $i$-th digit by $1$. After applying the up move on $9$, it becomes $0$.

down move (denoted by ${D}$): it decreases the $i$-th digit by $1$. After applying the down move on $0$, it becomes $9$.

Example for $n=4$. The current sequence is 0 0 0 0.

Luca knows the final sequence of wheels and the moves for each wheel. Help him find the original sequence and crack the cypher.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) — the number of wheels.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 9$) — the digit shown on the $i$-th wheel after all moves have been performed.

Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains the integer $b_i$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 10$) and $b_i$ characters that are either ${U}$ or ${D}$ — the number of moves performed on the $i$-th wheel, and the moves performed. ${U}$ and ${D}$ represent an up move and a down move respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output $n$ space-separated digits  — the initial sequence of the cypher.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, we can prove that initial sequence was $[2,1,1]$. In that case, the following moves were performed:

On the first wheel: $2 \xrightarrow[{D}]{} 1 \xrightarrow[{D}]{} 0 \xrightarrow[{D}]{} 9$.

On the second wheel: $1 \xrightarrow[{U}]{} 2 \xrightarrow[{D}]{} 1 \xrightarrow[{U}]{} 2 \xrightarrow[{U}]{} 3$.

On the third wheel: $1 \xrightarrow[{D}]{} 0 \xrightarrow[{U}]{} 1$.

The final sequence was $[9,3,1]$, which matches the input.
